# Document-Retrival-using-Clustering
The project is implemented using k-nearest neighbors clustering algorithm. Here I have built three knn models   
One based on 'TF-IDF' features and 'Euclidean Distance'  
One based on 'TF-IDF' features and 'Cosine Distance'  
One based on 'word_count' features and 'Cosine Distance'   
# Requirements
Graphlab Create  
Anaconda2  
IPython Notebook
#
Download the people_wiki.sframe dataset file.
# Analysis of the different models
It can be seen that the nearest neighbors for an individual differ in all the three models.
